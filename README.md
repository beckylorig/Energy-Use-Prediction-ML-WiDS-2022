# WiDS_Energy_Analysis

Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon 2022 - Climate Change Evaluation
The goal of the competition this year is to analyze building energy efficiency and create models to predict building energy consumption, known as 'energy use intensity' (EUI). The datasets contain building features, energy star ratings, building age, and the weather features where the building is located (anonymized). Energy use by buildings is a contibutor to climate change, and this datathon aims to understand building energy expenditures as a means to combat climate change.

The datasets follow the Kaggle competition design. They include training dataset and test dataset. The training data has the target field but the test data does not. The goal is to predict the target variable for the test dataset and submit it for scoring in Kaggle. This dataset has a continuous target variable rather than binary variable. The scoring by Kaggle is RMSE, which is used throughout the analysis.
